## rspace-client eln importWord

Import MSOffice Word files (doc, docx or odt)

### Synopsis

 Import Word files as RSpace document. Add files and folders to the command line. 
Files and folders are scanned for Word documents and converted

Use the --recursive flag to scan all folder tree contents.

Any folder structure in the input is flattened in RSpace. 
Documents are generated in 'folder' or HomeFolder if 'folder' is not set.

Files or folder names starting with '.' are ignored. But you can use '.' as an argument
to scan the current folder, e.g.

If you are importing many files, and cancel the operation while it is still running by a Ctrl-C
or other interrupt signal, the files *not* imported will be listed in stderr or in a file
specified by the --logfile argument.
