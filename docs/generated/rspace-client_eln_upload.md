## rspace-client eln upload

Upload one or more files or folders

### Synopsis

 Upload files. Add files and folders to the command line. 
	By default, folder contents aren't uploaded recursively.
	
	Use the --recursive flag to upload all folder tree contents.
	
	Any folder structure in the input is flattened in RSpace. Files are uploaded to the target folder.
	
	If explicit folder is not set, files will be uploaded to the appropriate 'Api Inbox' Gallery folders,
	depending on the file type. 

	Files or folder names starting with '.' are ignored. But you can use '.' as an argument
	to upload the current folder

	The --add-summary flag creates a document in your Home Folder with links to all 
	the uploaded files, as a reference to the uploaded files.

	If you are uploading many files, and cancel the operation while it is still running by a Ctrl-C
	or other interrupt signal, the files *not* uploaded will be listed in stderr or in a file
	specified by the --logfile argument.
